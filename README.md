### What is special about Astro Devblog?

Astro devblog has several benefits for use as a developer blog.

1. Completely serverless (no need to pay for hosting with awesome tools like [Netlify](https://netlify.com))
2. Automatically post to [Medium](https://medium.com) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/), two blogging platforms often used by developers.
3. Extensibility - I have done nothing fancy with this template. If you want to change something, it shoudn't be too difficult to do so.
4. Static - Astro âœ¨ships zero JavaScript by defaultâœ¨ which means that Astro Devblog is ðŸ”¥blazingly fastðŸ”¥
