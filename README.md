# Welcome to [Astro Devblog](https://astro-devblog.netlify.app)

See the [blog post](https://astro-devblog.netlify.app/article/how-to-use-astro-devblog) or the [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/8c7_vX3XPDc).

Before deploying to Netlify, generate a [CockroachDB serverless database](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/) and copy the connection string.

### What is special about Astro Devblog?

Astro devblog has several benefits for use as a developer blog.

1. Completely serverless (no need to pay for hosting with awesome tools like [Netlify](https://netlify.com))
2. Automatically post to [Medium](https://medium.com) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/), two blogging platforms often used by developers.
3. Extensibility - I have done nothing fancy with this template. If you want to change something, it shoudn't be too difficult to do so.
4. Static - Astro âœ¨ships zero JavaScript by defaultâœ¨ which means that Astro Devblog is ðŸ”¥blazingly fastðŸ”¥.

I'm done actively contributing to this template (unless I decide otherwise), but if you see something that can be improved, feel free to submit a PR. Three things that come to mind:

1. Image optimizations
2. Improved security (encrypt API tokens in db)
3. Improve the UI/styling
